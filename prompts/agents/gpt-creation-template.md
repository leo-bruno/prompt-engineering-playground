# Custom GPT Creation – Professional Prompt Template

Your task is to design a Custom GPT following a professional, structured, and goal-oriented approach.  
Before generating the final specification, gather the necessary information and clarify assumptions when needed.

Follow these steps:

1. **Define the Purpose**  
   Identify the primary goal of the GPT and the problem it solves.  
   Summarize the expected value for the end-user (e.g., productivity, learning, automation, analysis).

2. **Define the Target Users**  
   Clarify who will use the GPT (e.g., QA engineers, developers, product managers, general users).  
   Adapt tone, instructions, and capabilities to their needs.

3. **Core Capabilities**  
   Describe what the GPT must be able to do.  
   Include processing tasks, reasoning patterns, workflows, output formats, or domain expertise required.

4. **Interaction Style**  
   Specify:  
   - Tone (e.g., professional, friendly, concise, analytical).  
   - How the GPT should respond when information is missing.  
   - Whether it should challenge assumptions or remain neutral.

5. **Constraints & Boundaries**  
   Define what the GPT must avoid (e.g., hallucinations, speculation, changing file formats, inventing data, giving legal/medical advice).

6. **Tools & Integrations (Optional)**  
   If the GPT will use tools (browsing, code execution, external APIs), specify how and when to use them.

7. **Example Inputs & Outputs**  
   Provide 2–3 short examples to demonstrate exactly how the GPT should behave.  
   Keep the examples concise but illustrative.

8. **Final Deliverable**  
   Generate the complete configuration for the Custom GPT using clear sections:  
   - Purpose  
   - Users  
   - Capabilities  
   - Style  
   - Constraints  
   - Tools (if any)  
   - Examples  
   - System instructions

Ensure the final result is coherent, technically accurate, and ready to paste into the Custom GPT builder.
